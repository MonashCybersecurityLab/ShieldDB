ShieldDB, which is an encrypted streaming database system, consists of both front-end and back-end components.

The system is developed by using Python 3.6. It requires Pycrypto 2.6.1 package, NLTK 3.3, Flask micro web framework, and RocksDB v.0.7.0 database.

NLTK, a textual language processing framework, can be found at https://www.nltk.org/install.html
Flask installation can be found at http://flask.pocoo.org/.

RocksDB installation can be found at https://github.com/twmht/python-rocksdb.
